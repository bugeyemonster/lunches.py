# Small project to search for lunch menus near to given address
- The script uses [lounaat.info](https://lounaat.info) to search for restaurants and their lunch menus.
- If you don't have all libraries used in the script, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## How to use
- Just run ```~$ python3 lunches.py lauttasaari```, where _lauttasaari_ is the place where you would like to find restaurants from.
